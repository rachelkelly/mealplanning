Meal Planning!

Want to have a thing which will take in new recipes, ingredient by ingredient and direction by 
direction and make it fully indexable.  I've successfully gotten Python to be happy with 
making a new file out of whatever the user initially inputs, so that's really cool, but there 
are more than a few kinks I need to work out, but none of them really seem insurmountable!  
YEAH
